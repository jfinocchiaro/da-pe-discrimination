This paper studies optimization with arbitrary choice sets and shows that the traditional envelope formula holds at any differentiability point of the value function. We also provide conditions for the value function to be, variously, absolutely continuous, left- and right-differentiable, or fully differentiable. These results are applied to mechanism design, convex programming, continuous optimization problems, saddle-point problems, problems with parameterized constraints, and optimal stopping problems.},

This analysis provides an account of the underlying mathematics of mechanism design based on linear programming. Three advantages characterize the approach. The first is simplicity: arguments based on linear programming are both elementary and transparent. The second is unity: the machinery of linear programming provides a way to unify results from disparate areas of mechanism design. The third is reach: the technique offers the ability to solve problems that appear to be beyond solutions offered by traditional methods. No claim is made that the approach advocated should supplant traditional mathematical machinery. Rather, the approach represents an addition to the tools of the economic theorist who proposes to understand economic phenomena through the lens of mechanism design"--},

Single-call mechanisms are a powerful tool that circumvents this obstacle --- they implicitly charge truthful payments, guaranteeing truthfulness in expectation using only the outcome realized by the mechanism. The cost of such truthfulness is a trade-off between the expected quality of the outcome and the risk of large payments. We largely settle when and to what extent single-call mechanisms are possible. The first single-call construction was discovered by Babaioff, Kleinberg, and Slivkins [2010] in single-parameter domains. They give a transformation that turns any monotone, single-parameter allocation rule into a truthful-in-expectation single-call mechanism. Our first result is a natural complement to[Babaioff et al. 2010]: we give a new transformation that produces a single-call VCG mechanism from any allocation rule for which VCG payments are truthful. Second, in both the single-parameter and VCG settings, we precisely characterize the possible transformations, showing that that a wide variety of transformations are possible but that all take a very simple form. Finally, we study the inherent trade-off between the expected quality of the outcome and the risk of large payments. We show that our construction and that of [Babaioff et al. 2010] simultaneously optimize a variety of metrics in their respective domains. Our study is motivated by settings where uncertainty in a mechanism renders other known techniques untruthful. As an example, we analyze pay-per-click advertising auctions, where the truthfulness of the standard VCG-based auction is easily broken when the auctioneer's estimated click-through-rates are imprecise.},

It is shown that if the scores are additive for different events and if the person chooses admissible values only, then there exists a known transform of the values x to values which are probabilities. In particular, it follows that values x derived by significance tests, confidence intervals or by the rules of fuzzy logic are inadmissible. Only probability is a sensible description of uncertainty. ␥ Supposons qu'une personne exprime son incertitude à l'égard d'un événement E, qui est conditionné à un événement F, par un nombre x, et supposons qu'on lui assigne, comme résultat, un nombre s qui dépend de x et de la vérité ou de la fausseté de E quand F est vrai. On démontre que si les nombres s sont additives pour des événements différents, et que si la personne ne choisit que des valeurs admissibles, alors il existe une transformation connue des valeurs x aux valeurs qui sont des probabilités. En particulier, il en résulte que des valeurs x dérivées des tests de signification, des intervalles de confiance ou des règles de 'fuzzy logic' sont inadmissibles. Seule la probabilité est une description raisonnable de l'incertitude.},

	abstract = {Quantile assessments are commonly encountered in the elicitation of probability distributions in decision analysis, forecasting, and risk analysis. Scoring rules have been developed to provide ex ante incentives for careful and truthful assessments and ex post evaluation measures in the context of probability assessment. We show that these scoring rules designed for probability assessment provide inappropriate incentives if used for quantile assessment. We investigate the properties of a linear family of scoring rules that are intended specifically for quantile assessment (including the assessment of multiple quantiles) and can be related to a realistic decision-making problem. These rules provide proper incentives for quantile assessment and yield higher expected scores for distributions that are more informative in the sense of having less dispersion. We discuss the special case of interval forecasts and a generalization involving transformations, and we briefly mention other possible extensions.},

@article{gneiting2011making,
	title = {Making and {Evaluating} {Point} {Forecasts}},
	volume = {106},
	abstract = {Typically, point forecasting methods are compared and assessed by means of an error measure or scoring function, with the absolute error and the squared error being key examples. The individual scores are averaged over forecast cases, to result in a summary measure of the predictive performance, such as the mean absolute error or the mean squared error. I demonstrate that this common practice can lead to grossly misguided inferences, unless the scoring function and the forecasting task are carefully matched. Effective point forecasting requires that the scoring function be specified ex ante, or that the forecaster receives a directive in the form of a statistical functional, such as the mean or a quantile of the predictive distribution. If the scoring function is specified ex ante, the forecaster can issue the optimal point forecast, namely, the Bayes rule. If the forecaster receives a directive in the form of a functional, it is critical that the scoring function be consistent for it, in the sense that the expected score is minimized when following the directive. A functional is elicitable if there exists a scoring function that is strictly consistent for it. Expectations, ratios of expectations and quantiles are elicitable. For example, a scoring function is consistent for the mean functional if and only if it is a Bregman function. It is consistent for a quantile if and only if it is generalized piecewise linear. Similar characterizations apply to ratios of expectations and to expectiles. Weighted scoring functions are consistent for functionals that adapt to the weighting in peculiar ways. Not all functionals are elicitable; for instance, conditional value-at-risk is not, despite its popularity in quantitative finance.},

It is well known that the conditional expectation E[X{\textbar}Z] is the optimal L2 predictor (also known as "the least-mean-square error" predictor) of X, among all (Borel measurable) functions of Z. In this orrespondence, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the general loss functions under which the conditional expectation is the unique optimal predictor. We show that E[X{\textbar}Z] is the optimal predictor for all Bregman loss functions (BLFs), of which the L2 loss function is a special case. Moreover, under mild conditions, we show that the BLFs are exhaustive, i.e., if for every random variable X, the infimum of E[F(X,y)] over all constants y is attained by the expectation E[X], then F is a BLF.},

	abstract = {Proper scoring rules, particularly when used as the basis for
a prediction market, are powerful tools for eliciting and aggregating
beliefs about events such as the likely outcome of
an election or sporting event. Such scoring rules incentivize
a single agent to reveal her true beliefs about the event.
Othman and Sandholm [16] introduced the idea of a decision
rule to examine these problems in contexts where the
information being elicited is conditional on some decision alternatives.
For example, {\textbackslash}What is the probability having ten
million viewers if we choose to air new television show X?
What if we choose Y?" Since only one show can actually air
in a slot, only the results under the chosen alternative can
ever be observed. Othman and Sandholm developed proper
scoring rules (and thus decision markets) for a single, deterministic
decision rule: always select the the action with the
greatest probability of success. In this work we signi⬚cantly
generalize their results, developing scoring rules for other
deterministic decision rules, randomized decision rules, and
situations where there may be more than two outcomes (e.g.
less than a million viewers, more than one but less than ten,
or more than ten million).},

The game involves three parties—advertisers, the search engine, and search users—and we present example research directions that emphasize the role of each. The algorithms for bidding and pricing in these games use techniques from three mathematical areas: mechanism design, optimization, and statistical estimation.

This book, which is the product of a collaboration of over 15 years, is unique in that it focuses on convex functions themselves, rather than on convex analysis. The authors explore the various classes and their characteristics and applications, treating convex functions in both Euclidean and Banach spaces. The book can either be read sequentially for a graduate course, or dipped into by researchers and practitioners. Each chapter contains a variety of specific examples, and over 600 exercises are included, ranging in difficulty from early graduate to research level.},

The results are furthermore applied to correction of vertex-position errors, discrimination between correct and incorrect line drawings, recognition of unique solvability of some figure-construction problems, classification of line drawings, and other related problems.},

The "backbone" of bot volumes was extracted, some material deleted which was deemed too advanced for an introduction, or too closely attached to numerical algorithms.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.5518},
	abstract = {We provide a reduction from revenue maximization to welfare maximization in multi-dimensional Bayesian auctions with arbitrary (possibly combinatorial) feasibility constraints and independent bidders with arbitrary (possibly combinatorial) demand constraints, appropriately extending Myerson's result to this setting. We also show that every feasible Bayesian auction can be implemented as a distribution over virtual VCG allocation rules. A virtual VCG allocation rule has the following simple form: Every bidder's type t\_i is transformed into a virtual type f\_i(t\_i), via a bidder-specific function. Then, the allocation maximizing virtual welfare is chosen. Using this characterization, we show how to find and run the revenue-optimal auction given only black box access to an implementation of the VCG allocation rule. We generalize this result to arbitrarily correlated bidders, introducing the notion of a second-order VCG allocation rule. We obtain our reduction from revenue to welfare optimization via two algorithmic results on reduced forms in settings with arbitrary feasibility and demand constraints. First, we provide a separation oracle for determining feasibility of a reduced form. Second, we provide a geometric algorithm to decompose any feasible reduced form into a distribution over virtual VCG allocation rules. In addition, we show how to execute both algorithms given only black box access to an implementation of the VCG allocation rule. Our results are computationally efficient for all multi-dimensional settings where the bidders are additive. In this case, our mechanisms run in time polynomial in the total number of bidder types, but not type profiles. For generic correlated distributions, this is the natural description complexity of the problem. The runtime can be further improved to poly(\#items, \#bidders) in item-symmetric settings by making use of recent techniques.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a general notion of stress on cell-complexes and reports on connections between stresses and liftings (generalization of C 1 0 -splines) of d -dimensional cell-complexes in R d . New sufficient conditions for the existence of a sharp lifting for a ``flat" piecewise-linear realization of a manifold are given. Our approach also gives some new results on the equivalence between spherical complexes and convex and star polytopes. As an application, two algorithms are given that determine whether a piecewise-linear realization of a d -manifold in R d admits a lifting to R d+1 which satisfies given constraints. We also demonstrate connections between stresses and Voronoi—Dirichlet diagrams and show that any weighted Voronoi—Dirichlet diagram without non-compact cells can be represented as a weighted Delaunay decomposition and vice versa.},

	abstract = {We study prediction and estimation problems using empirical risk minimization, relative to a general convex loss function. We obtain sharp error rates even when concentration is false or is very restricted, for example, in heavy-tailed scenarios. Our results show that the error rate depends on two parameters: one captures the intrinsic complexity of the class, and essentially leads to the error rate in a noise-free (or realizable) problem; the other measures interactions between class members the target and the loss, and is dominant when the problem is far from realizable. We also explain how one may deal with outliers by choosing the loss in a way that is calibrated to the intrinsic complexity of the class and to the noise-level of the problem (the latter is measured by the distance between the target and the class).},

	abstract = {Multi-label learning has attracted much attention during the past few years. Many multi-label approaches have been developed, mostly working with surrogate loss functions because multi-label loss functions are usually difficult to optimize directly owing to their non-convexity and discontinuity. These approaches are effective empirically, however, little effort has been devoted to the understanding of their consistency, i.e., the convergence of the risk of learned functions to the Bayes risk. In this paper, we present a theoretical analysis on this important issue. We first prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the consistency of multi-label learning based on surrogate loss functions. Then, we study the consistency of two well-known multi-label loss functions, i.e., ranking loss and hamming loss. For ranking loss, our results disclose that, surprisingly, none of convex surrogate loss is consistent; we present the partial ranking loss, with which some surrogate losses are proven to be consistent. We also discuss on the consistency of univariate surrogate losses. For hamming loss, we show that two multi-label learning methods, i.e., one-vs-all and pairwise comparison, which can be regarded as direct extensions from multi-class learning, are inconsistent in general cases yet consistent under the dominating setting, and similar results also hold for some recent multi-label approaches that are variations of one-vs-all. In addition, we discuss on the consistency of learning approaches that address multi-label learning by decomposing into a set of binary classification problems.},

They also need to be well-posed in the sense of being stable, so that they might be used robustly. We propose a statistical form of stability, defined as leave-one-out (LOO) stability. We prove that for bounded loss classes LOO stability is (a) sufficient for generalization, that is convergence in probability of the empirical error to the expected error, for any algorithm satisfying it and, (b) necessary and sufficient for consistency of ERM. Thus LOO stability is a weak form of stability that represents a sufficient condition for generalization for symmetric learning algorithms while subsuming the classical conditions for consistency of ERM. In particular, we conclude that a certain form of well-posedness and consistency are equivalent for ERM.},

Various criteria may be proposed to assess Forecaster's empirical performance. The weak prequential principle requires that such a criterion should depend on Forecaster's behaviour or strategy only through the actual forecasts issued. A wide variety of appealing criteria are shown to respect this principle. We further show that many such criteria also obey the strong prequential principle, which requires that, when both Nature and Forecaster make their choices in accordance with a common joint distribution P for (X1,X2,... ), certain stochastic properties, underlying and justifying the criterion and inferences based on it, hold regardless of the detailed specification of P. In order to understand further this compliant behaviour, we introduce the prequential framework, a game-theoretic basis for probability theory in which it is impossible to violate the prequential principles, and we describe its connections with classical probability theory. In this framework, in order to show that some criterion for assessing Forecaster's empirical performance is valid, we have to exhibit a winning strategy for a third player, Statistician, in a certain perfect-information game. We demonstrate that many performance criteria can be formulated and are valid in this framework and, therefore, satisfy both prequential principles.},

On the other hand, it is natural to expect that good experts’ predictions will in some way agree with the actual outcomes (e.g., they will be accurate on the average). In this paper we show that, in the case of the Brier prediction game (also known as the square-loss game), the predictions of a good (in some weak and natural sense) expert must satisfy the law of large numbers (both strong and weak) and the law of the iterated logarithm; we also show that two good experts’ predictions must be in asymptotic agreement. To help the reader's intuition, we give a Kolmogorov-complexity interpretation of our results. Finally, we briefly discuss possible extensions of our results to more general games; the limit theorems for sequences of events in conventional probability theory correspond to the log-loss game.},

As this risk measure has to be estimated from historical data, it is important to be able to verify and compare competing estimation procedures. In statistical decision theory, risk measures for which such verification and comparison is possible, are called elicitable. It is known that quantile based risk measures such as value at risk are elicitable. In this paper we show that law-invariant spectral risk measures such as expected shortfall are not elicitable unless they reduce to minus the expected value. Hence, it is unclear how to perform forecast verification or comparison. However, the class of elicitable law-invariant coherent risk measures does not reduce to minus the expected value. We show that it consists of certain expectiles.},

	abstract = {A statistical functional, such as the mean or the median, is called elicitable if there is a scoring function or loss function such that the correct forecast of the functional is the unique minimizer of the expected score. Such scoring functions are called strictly consistent for the functional. The elicitability of a functional opens the possibility to compare competing forecasts and to rank them in terms of their realized scores. In this paper, we explore the notion of elicitability for multi-dimensional functionals and give both necessary and sufficient conditions for strictly consistent scoring functions. We cover the case of functionals with elicitable components, but we also show that one-dimensional functionals that are not elicitable can be a component of a higher order elicitable functional. In the case of the variance this is a known result. However, an important result of this paper is that spectral risk measures with a spectral measure with finite support are jointly elicitable if one adds the `correct' quantiles. A direct consequence of applied interest is that the pair (Value at Risk, Expected Shortfall) is jointly elicitable under mild conditions that are usually fulfilled in risk management applications.},

We show that a key property of mixability generalizes, and the exp and log operations present in the usual theory are not as special as one might have thought. In doing this we introduce a more general notion of \${\textbackslash}Phi\$-mixability where \${\textbackslash}Phi\$ is a general entropy ({\textbackslash}ie, any convex function on probabilities). We show how a property shared by the convex dual of any such entropy yields a natural algorithm (the minimizer of a regret bound) which, analogous to the classical aggregating algorithm, is guaranteed a constant regret when used with \${\textbackslash}Phi\$-mixable losses. We characterize precisely which \${\textbackslash}Phi\$ have \${\textbackslash}Phi\$-mixable losses and put forward a number of conjectures about the optimality and relationships between different choices of entropy.},

In the binary case, scoring rules (which are strictly proper) allow for a decomposition into terms related to the resolution and to the reliability of the forecast. This fact is particularly well known for the Brier Score. In this paper, this result is extended to forecasts for finite--valued targets. Both resolution and reliability are shown to have a positive effect on the score. It is demonstrated that resolution and reliability are directly related to forecast attributes which are desirable on grounds independent of the notion of scores. This finding can be considered an epistemological justification of measuring forecast quality by proper scores. A link is provided to the original work of DeGroot et al (1982), extending their concepts of sufficiency and refinement. The relation to the conjectured sharpness principle of Gneiting et al (2005a) is elucidated.},

The quality of crowdsourced labels is, however, adversely affected by three factors: (1) the workers are not experts; (2) the incentives of the workers are not aligned with those of the requesters; and (3) the interface does not allow workers to convey their knowledge accurately, by forcing them to make a single choice among a set of options. In this paper, we address these issues by introducing approval voting to utilize the expertise of workers who have partial knowledge of the true answer, and coupling it with a ("strictly proper") incentive-compatible compensation mechanism. We show rigorous theoretical guarantees of optimality of our mechanism together with a simple axiomatic characterization. We also conduct empirical studies on Amazon Mechanical Turk which validate our approach.},

Legislative outcomes depend on those rules and on the structure of the legislature. Although the social choice literature provides theories about voting equilibria, it does not endogenize the formation of the agenda on which the voting is based and rarely takes into account the institutional structure found in legislatures. In our theory members of the legislature act noncooperatively in choosing strategies to serve their own districts, explicitly taking into account the strategies members adopt in response to the sequential nature of proposal making and voting. The model permits the characterization of a legislative equilibrium reflecting the structure of the legislature and also allows consideration of the choice of elements of that structure in a context in which the standard, institution-free model of social choice theory yields no equilibrium.},

In the second part, the idea of dynamic hedging of contingent claims is developed in a multiperiod framework. Such models are typically incomplete: They involve intrinsic risks which cannot be hedged away completely. Topics include martingale measures, pricing formulas for derivatives, American options, superhedging, and hedging strategies with minimal shortfall risk. In addition to many corrections and improvements, this second edition contains several new sections, including a systematic discussion of law-invariant risk measures and of the connections between American options, superhedging, and dynamic risk measures.},

	abstract = {The question of pricing and hedging a given contingent claim has a unique solution in a complete market framework. When some incompleteness is introduced, the problem becomes however more difficult. Several approaches have been adopted in the literature to provide a satisfactory answer to this problem, for a particular choice criterion. In this paper, in order to price and hedge a non-tradable contingent claim, we first start with a (standard) utility maximization problem and end up with an equivalent risk measure minimization. This hedging problem can be seen as a particular case of a more general situation of risk transfer between different agents, one of them consisting of the financial market. In order to provide constructive answers to this general optimal risk transfer problem, both static and dynamic approaches are considered. When considering a dynamic framework, our main purpose is to find a trade-off between static and very abstract risk measures as we are more interested in tractability issues and interpretations of the dynamic risk measures we obtain rather than the ultimate general results. Therefore, after introducing a general axiomatic approach to dynamic risk measures, we relate the dynamic version of convex risk measures to BSDEs.},

	abstract = {We study the problem of eliciting and aggregating probabilistic information from multiple agents. In order to successfully aggregate the predictions of agents, the principal needs to elicit some notion of confidence from agents, capturing how much experience or knowledge led to their predictions. To formalize this, we consider a principal who wishes to elicit predictions about a random variable from a group of Bayesian agents, each of whom have privately observed some independent samples of the random variable, and hopes to aggregate the predictions as if she had directly observed the samples of all agents. Leveraging techniques from Bayesian statistics, we represent confidence as the number of samples an agent has observed, which is quantified by a hyperparameter from a conjugate family of prior distributions. This then allows us to show that if the principal has access to a few samples, she can achieve her aggregation goal by eliciting predictions from agents using proper scoring rules. In particular, if she has access to one sample, she can successfully aggregate the agents' predictions if and only if every posterior predictive distribution corresponds to a unique value of the hyperparameter. Furthermore, this uniqueness holds for many common distributions of interest. When this uniqueness property does not hold, we construct a novel and intuitive mechanism where a principal with two samples can elicit and optimally aggregate the agents' predictions.},

	abstract = {Ever since the Internet opened the floodgates to millions of users, each looking after their own interests, modern algorithm design has needed to be increasingly robust to strategic manipulation. Often, it is the inputs to these algorithms which are provided by strategic agents, who may lie for their own benefit, necessitating the design of algorithms which incentivize the truthful revelation of private information – but how can this be done? This is a fundamental question with answers from many disciplines, from mechanism design to scoring rules and prediction markets. Each domain has its own model with its own assumptions, yet all seek schemes to gather private information from selfish agents, by leveraging incentives. Together, we refer to such models as elicitation. This dissertation unifies and advances the theory of incentivized information elicitation. Using tools from convex analysis, we introduce a new model of elicitation with a matching characterization theorem which together encompass mechanism design, scoring rules, prediction markets, and other models. This lays a firm foundation on which the rest of the dissertation is built. It is natural to consider a setting where agents report some alternate representation of their private information, called a property, rather than reporting it directly. We extend our model and characterization to this setting, revealing even deeper ties to convex analysis and convex duality, and we use these connections to prove new results for linear, smooth nonlinear, and finite-valued properties. Exploring the linear case further, we show a new four-fold equivalence between scoring rules, prediction markets, Bregman divergences, and generalized exponential families. Applied to mechanism design, our framework offers a new perspective. By focusing on the (convex) consumer surplus function, we simplify a number of existing results, from the classic revenue equivalence theorem, to more recent characterizations of mechanism implementability. Finally, we follow a line of research on the interpretation of prediction markets, relating a new stochastic framework to the classic Walrasian equilibrium and to stochastic mirror descent, thereby strengthening ties between prediction markets and machine learning.},

An eigenvector of L(G) corresponding to the eigenvalue a(G) is called a Fiedler vector of G. Let Y be a Fiedler vector of G. A characteristic vertex is a vertex u of G such that Y(u) = 0 and such that there is a vertex w adjacent to u satisfying Y(w) ≠ 0. A characteristic edge is an edge \{u, v\} such that Y(u)Y(v) \&lt; 0. The characteristic set S is the collection of all characteristic vertices and characteristic edges of G with respect to Y. A Perron branch at S is a connected component of G ⧹ S with the smallest eigenvalue of the corresponding principal submatrix of L(G) less than or equal to a(G). Suppose that S contains vertices only and that there are t Perron branches of G at S. We show that in this case the multiplicity of a(G) is at least t − 1 and t − 1 of the linearly independent Fiedler vectors can be constructed from the positive eigenvectors of the Perron branches. We also show that the condition “for each Fiedler vector Y, the characteristic set contains vertices only” is equivalent to “the multiplicity of a(G) is exactly t − 1”. We characterize the graphs in which spectral integral variation occurs in one place by adding an edge where the changed eigenvalue is the algebraic connectivity.},

We quantify this risk using the concept of risk measures from finance, and introduce a class of trade dynamics which allow agents to trade contracts contingent upon the future outcome. We then show that these trade dynamics exactly correspond to a variant of randomized coordinate descent. By extending the analysis of these coordinate descent methods to account for our more organic setting, we are able to show convergence rates for very general trade dynamics, showing that the market or network converges to a unique steady state. Applying these results to prediction markets, we expand on recent results by adding convergence rates and general aggregation properties. Finally, we illustrate the generality of our framework by applying it to agent interactions on a scale-free network.},

	abstract = {We introduce a framework for automated market making for prediction markets, the volume parameterized market (VPM), in which securities are priced based on the market maker's current liabilities as well as the total volume of trade in the market. We provide a set of mathematical tools that can be used to analyze markets in this framework, and show that many existing market makers (including cost-function based markets [Chen and Pennock 2007; Abernethy et al. 2011, 2013], profit-charging markets [Othman and Sandholm 2012], and buy-only markets [Li and Vaughan 2013]) all fall into this framework as special cases. Using the framework, we design a new market maker, the perspective market, that satisfies four desirable properties (worst-case loss, no arbitrage, increasing liquidity, and shrinking spread) in the complex market setting, but fails to satisfy information incorporation. However, we show that the sacrifice of information incorporation is unavoidable: we prove an impossibility result showing that any market maker that prices securities based only on the trade history cannot satisfy all five properties simultaneously. Instead, we show that perspective markets may satisfy a weaker notion that we call center-price information incorporation.},

Multivariate estimation methods are analyzed in depth, including non-parametric, maximum-likelihood under non-normal hypotheses, shrinkage, robust, and very general Bayesian techniques. Evaluation methods such as stochastic dominance, expected utility, value at risk and coherent measures are thoroughly discussed in a unified setting and applied in a variety of contexts, including prospect theory, total return and benchmark allocation.  Portfolio optimization is presented with emphasis on estimation risk, which is tackled by means of Bayesian, resampling and robust optimization techniques.  All the statistical and mathematical tools, such as copulas, location-dispersion ellipsoids, matrix-variate distributions, cone programming, are introduced from the basics. Comprehension is supported by a large number of figures and examples, as well as real trading and asset management case studies.  At symmys.com the reader will find freely downloadable complementary materials: the Exercise Book; a set of thoroughly documented MATLAB® applications; and the Technical Appendices with all the proofs.

	abstract = {Every mathematical discipline goes through three periods of development: the naive, the formal, and the critical. David Hilbert The goal of this book is to explain the principles that made support vector machines (SVMs) a successful modeling and prediction tool for a variety of applications. We try to achieve this by presenting the basic ideas of SVMs together with the latest developments and current research questions in a uni?ed style. In a nutshell, we identify at least three reasons for the success of SVMs: their ability to learn well with only a very small number of free parameters, their robustness against several types of model violations and outliers, and last but not least their computational e?ciency compared with several other methods. Although there are several roots and precursors of SVMs, these methods gained particular momentum during the last 15 years since Vapnik (1995, 1998) published his well-known textbooks on statistical learning theory with aspecialemphasisonsupportvectormachines. Sincethen,the?eldofmachine learninghaswitnessedintenseactivityinthestudyofSVMs,whichhasspread moreandmoretootherdisciplinessuchasstatisticsandmathematics. Thusit seems fair to say that several communities are currently working on support vector machines and on related kernel-based methods. Although there are many interactions between these communities, we think that there is still roomforadditionalfruitfulinteractionandwouldbegladifthistextbookwere found helpful in stimulating further research. Many of the results presented in this book have previously been scattered in the journal literature or are still under review.

This regression is based on a strictly consistent loss function for the pair quantile and ES, which allows for M- and Z-estimation of the joint regression parameters. We show consistency and asymptotic normality for both, the M- and the Z-estimator under standard regularity conditions. The underlying loss function depends on two specification functions, whose choice affects the properties of the resulting estimators. Extensive simulations verify the asymptotic properties and analyze the small sample behavior of the M-estimator for different specification functions. We find that the Z-estimator is numerically unstable and thus, we rely on M-estimation of the model parameters. This joint regression framework allows for various applications including estimating, forecasting and backtesting ES, which is particularly relevant in light of the recent introduction of ES in the Basel Accords.},

The overall obstacle avoidance problem is typically studied as two or three separate subproblems. Unfortunately, such an approach can lead to unrealistic assumptions being made about the other subsystems or specification of unnecessarily high levels of subsystem performance. In this paper, we present an approach to obstacle avoidance in the context of a multilayered, multi-objective control architecture that considers both the aircraft dynamics and sensor limitations in an integrated framework. Specifically, the concept of reachable sets is extended to include the error model of parallel-baseline, stereovision. An analytical solution is presented for the planar motion of a single unmanned aircraft. In addition, the extension to groups of UAV is introduced.},

However, the task is challenging under the situation where a large amount of uncertainty exists in the available information (e.g., model outputs). This paper investigates the effect of uncertainty on the ranking of options in water management. Different methods for ranking the management options under uncertainty are reviewed and they account for only partial uncertainty information in model outputs. To consider the full uncertainty information, a new ranking procedure is proposed in this paper, which is capable of providing more information to decision makers and at the same time taking their opinions on uncertainty into consideration. The ranking is achieved by conducting pair-wise comparison of management options, on the basis of the risk defined by the probability of obtaining an unacceptable ranking and the mean difference in model outputs in pair-wise comparison. An application example is presented to illustrate the use of the proposed ranking approach. Furthermore, the sensitivity of management option ranking to different ranking methods and to model uncertainty is also investigated.},

CVaR is the average of the longest waiting times, i.e., a measure at the tail of the waiting time distribution. The presented results are based on a discrete event simulation (DES) model of an orthopedic surgical unit at a university hospital in Denmark. Our analysis shows that CVaR offers a highly reliable performance measure. The measure targets the longest waiting times and these are generally accepted to be the most problematic from the points of view of both the patients and the management. Moreover, CVaR can be seen as a compromise between the well known measures: average waiting time and the maximum waiting time.},

Often, uncertainty creates difficulty in ranking or comparing multiple water management options, possibly leading to a wrong decision. In this paper, an alternative risk measure is proposed to facilitate the ranking or comparison of water management options under uncertainty by using the concepts of conditional expected loss and partial mean. This measure has the advantages of being more intuitive, general and could relate to many other measures of risk in the literature. The application of the risk measure is demonstrated through a case study for the evaluation of flood mitigation projects. The results show that the new measure is applicable to a general decision-making process under uncertainty.},

This book maintains an approach to modeling and forecasting that utilizes tools related to risk theory, loss distributions, and survival models. Random variables, basic distributional quantities, the recursive method, and techniques for classifying and creating distributions are also discussed. Both parametric and non-parametric estimation methods are thoroughly covered along with advice for choosing an appropriate model. Features of the Third Edition include:  Extended discussion of risk management and risk measures, including Tail-Value-at-Risk (TVaR) New sections on extreme value distributions and their estimation Inclusion of homogeneous, nonhomogeneous, and mixed Poisson processes Expanded coverage of copula models and their estimation Additional treatment of methods for constructing confidence regions when there is more than one parameter  The book continues to distinguish itself by providing over 400 exercises that have appeared on previous SOA and CAS examinations. Intriguing examples from the fields of insurance and business are discussed throughout, and all data sets are available on the book's FTP site, along with programs that assist with conducting loss model analysis. Loss Models, Third Edition is an essential resource for students and aspiring actuaries who are preparing to take the SOA and CAS preliminary examinations. It is also a must-have reference for professional actuaries, graduate students in the actuarial field, and anyone who works with loss and risk models in their everyday work.

A psychological approach to decision-making facilitates the understanding and explaining of the complexity of foreign and global policies precisely because of the prolonged transitional stage of the contemporary international system. The course of world politics is shaped by the decisions of leaders. Uncertainty involved in decision-making in foreign policy can relate to the motivations, beliefs, intentions or calculations of the opponents. If it is not possible to understand how decisions are made, then maybe it is at least feasible to understand these decisions and, perhaps more importantly, predict various results with regards to international politics.This book provides a new perspective on the study of international relations by analyzing the subjective elements (idiosyncrasies) that occur in decision-making at the individual level. The use of psychological methods of analysing the foreign policy decision-making process proposes a necessary investigation path into international relations.},

On the basis of this definition he has proposed to consider those elements of a given large finite population to be random whose complexity is maximal. Almost all elements of the population have a complexity which is close to the maximal value. In this paper it is shown that the random elements as defined by Kolmogorov possess all conceivable statistical properties of randomness. They can equivalently be considered as the elements which withstand a certain universal stochasticity test. The definition is extended to infinite binary sequences and it is shown that the non random sequences form a maximal constructive null set. Finally, the Kollektivs introduced by von Alises obtain a definition which seems to satisfy all intuitive requirements.},
